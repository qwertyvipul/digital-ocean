Tips &amp; tricks for getting along DigitalOcean

## Getting started

1. When getting started first begin with the [initial server setup](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-18-04).

1. Once done with this maybe you'd like to work using GUI so try [setting up a VNC client](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-configure-vnc-on-ubuntu-18-04)

1. Now you would want to deploy some web applications on your server, so you would need to [setup Nginx](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-nginx-on-ubuntu-18-04)

1. Setting up Nginx is not enough, you also need to [secure Nginx](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-secure-nginx-with-let-s-encrypt-on-ubuntu-18-04).

1. Nodejs is one of the most popular web development framework so you might want to [create and deploy first node.js application](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-node-js-application-for-production-on-ubuntu-18-04).

1. Now you might also want to [install git](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-git-on-ubuntu-18-04) for version control.

1. You can also opt to [setup gitlab](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-configure-gitlab-on-ubuntu-18-04) if you have enough RAM on your instance (512MB is not enough).
